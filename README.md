# Assessing Risk of Health Outcomes from the Electroencephalogram of Sleep

This repository contains code to
1) reproduce the results in the paper ["reproduce_results" folder];
2) get risk prediction for a particiular sleep PSG recording ["risk_calculator" folder].

### How to Get Training Data

The data is a subset of The Human Sleep Project stored on the Brain Data Science Platform (BDSP): https://bdsp.io/content/hsp/2.0/

### How to Prepare PSG Data for risk Prediction

Step 1: feature extraction: EDF + sleep stage --> feature CSV (not yet done, I need to clear&upload this code soon)
Step 2: run risk_calculator/prediction-example.ipynb
